# About iDE? {-}

iDE is a global team of 1,200 changemakers coming from diverse backgrounds within international development and the private sector. What we all have in common is the belief that one entrepreneur can change their community and millions can change the world.

Our work stands out in the international development arena. We are driven to end poverty but we don’t do simple handouts of supplies or cash. Instead, we believe that everyone has the ability to increase their livelihoods and build long-term resilience by their own accord. They may just need training or connections to suppliers and customers. That’s where we come in and what we mean when we say we are “powering entrepreneurs to end poverty.”
